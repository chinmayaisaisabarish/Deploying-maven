# Deploying Maven Packages to GitHub Packages

This README explains why and how to deploy your Maven-built Java packages to GitHub Packages.

## What is Maven?

Maven is a powerful project management and build tool for Java. It uses a Project Object Model (POM) to manage:
* **Dependency Management:** Automatically handles project libraries.
* **Standardized Structure:** Keeps projects organized.
* **Build Lifecycle:** Defines standard build phases (compile, test, package, deploy).
* **Plugins:** Extensible for various tasks.

## Why GitHub Packages?

Deploying to GitHub Packages offers key benefits:
1.  **Centralized Libraries:** Publish reusable Java libraries for easy consumption by other projects.
2.  **Version Control:** Manage and distribute different versions of your artifacts.
3.  **Private Hosting:** Host internal libraries securely within your GitHub ecosystem.
4.  **GitHub Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories and Actions for CI/CD.
5.  **Easy Consumption:** Other developers can easily pull your packages.

## How to Deploy Maven Packages

Deployment involves configuring your Maven `settings.xml` (for authentication) and your project's `pom.xml` (`distributionManagement` for the deployment target).

### 1. `settings.xml` Configuration (Authentication)

This file holds your Maven credentials. For secure, automated builds (especially with GitHub Actions), it's **recommended to dynamically generate** your `settings.xml` instead of hardcoding sensitive tokens.

GitHub's `actions/setup-java` action handles this by configuring Maven with the secure `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```yaml
# Snippet from your GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/maven-publish.yml)
- name: Set up JDK and Maven settings
  uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
    java-version: '17' # Your project's Java version
    distribution: 'temurin'
    cache: maven
    server-id: github # Must match <id> in pom.xml's distributionManagement
    server-username: ${{ github.actor }}
    server-password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Securely uses auto-generated token
````

### 2\. `distributionManagement` in `pom.xml` (Deployment Target)

This section in your `pom.xml` tells Maven where to deploy your built artifact.

**Example `distributionManagement`:**

```xml
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>github</id>
    <name>GitHub Packages</name>
    <url>[https://maven.pkg.github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME](https://maven.pkg.github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME)</url>
  </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

**Important:** The `<id>github</id>` here **must match** the `server-id` configured in your `settings.xml`. The `<url>` specifies your GitHub Packages repository.

## Deployment Steps Summary

1.  **GitHub Repo:** Create a repository (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`).
2.  **`pom.xml`:** Add the `distributionManagement` section.
3.  **`settings.xml`:** Use GitHub Actions (`actions/setup-java`) for secure, dynamic configuration.
4.  **Deploy:** Run `mvn clean deploy` (typically within your GitHub Actions workflow).

This setup allows you to efficiently and securely publish your Java packages to GitHub Packages.
